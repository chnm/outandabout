LGBTQ+ history is a dynamic field that seeks to critically engage with queer lives of the past. We compiled a bibliography of academic material that influenced our project. These topics range from Virginia's queer history, queer Southern history, DC queer history, histories of cruising, histories of queer representation in media, and more. We hope this list serves as a gateway to other queer histories.

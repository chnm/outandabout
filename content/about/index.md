<h3>Project History</h3>
<p>This project began as a storymap for an introduction to digital history class in the fall of 2023. Our collective interests in public history, queer history, and mapping lead us to create a digital walking on Old Town Alexandria's queer history. Further funding allowed us to expand to the rest of Northern Virginia. While Washington D. C.'s queer history is well documented and studied, the larger metro area has received less attention. <i>Out and About in Northern Virginia</i> seeks to center Northern Virginia's queer history and explore how the suburban queer experience differed from its urban neighbor.</p>
<h3>Funding</h3>
<p>This project was made possible by the generous support of the Alexandria Historical Society's Golden Grant program and the Roy Rosenzweig Center for History and New Media's graduate student development fund.</p>
